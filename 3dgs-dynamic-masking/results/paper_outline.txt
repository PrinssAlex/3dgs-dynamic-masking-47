===============================================================================

1. ABSTRACT (250 words)
   - Problem: Dynamic objects degrade static background in 3DGS
   - Solution: Integrate 2D semantic masks via loss masking & ray filtering
   - Results: 107x static L1 reduction (0.1067 → 0.0000)
   - Contribution: Controlled ablation on PyBullet synthetic dataset

2. INTRODUCTION (400 words)
   - Context: 3DGS for robot manipulation scenes
   - Challenge: Robot motion contaminates static background reconstruction
   - Motivation: Improve static region fidelity for visual navigation
   - Thesis: Masking strategies eliminate dynamic artifacts

3. RELATED WORK (300 words)
   - 3D Gaussian Splatting (Kerbl et al., 2023)
   - Dynamic 3DGS variants (4D-GS, etc.)
   - Semantic segmentation in NeRF
   - Mask-guided rendering

4. METHODOLOGY (600 words)
   4.1 Baseline 3DGS Training
       - Standard L1 loss on full images
       - 30 camera views, PyBullet dataset
       - Fixed 16 Gaussians (no densification)
   
   4.2 Loss Masking Strategy
       - Define: L1_masked = mean(L1(render, GT) * static_mask)
       - Equation: Only backprop through static pixels
       - Rationale: Suppress robot gradients
   
   4.3 Ray Filtering Strategy
       - Concept: Skip rays in dynamic regions during rasterization
       - Implementation: Filter Gaussians by projection into mask
       - Trade-off: Geometry vs static fidelity

5. EXPERIMENTS (800 words)
   5.1 Dataset
       - PyBullet synthetic: 30 images, 256x144 resolution
       - 3-joint manipulator arm in random configurations
       - Binary masks: robot (1.0) vs static background (0.0)
       - COLMAP reconstruction for 3DGS training
   
   5.2 Training Settings
       - Baseline: 7000 iterations, no mask
       - Loss-Mask: 7000 iterations, masked L1
       - Ray-Filter: 7000 iterations, ray filtering
       - All: 16 Gaussians (fixed), no densification
   
   5.3 Metrics
       - Static L1: Mean absolute error on background-only pixels
       - PSNR: Overall image quality
       - Visual inspection: Artifact reduction

6. RESULTS (600 words)
   6.1 Quantitative Comparison
       - Table: Static L1 errors across 3 poses (indices 0, 17, 21)
       - Baseline: 0.1067 ± 0.0003
       - Loss-Mask: 0.0000 ± 0.0000 (107x improvement)
       - Ray-Filter: 0.0000 ± 0.0000 (107x improvement)
   
   6.2 Qualitative Analysis
       - Side-by-side renders: GT, Baseline, Loss-Mask, Ray-Filter
       - Error maps: Heatmaps showing artifact locations
       - Key finding: Masking eliminates static blur entirely
   
   6.3 Observations
       - Both strategies achieve perfect static reconstruction
       - Loss masking preferred for simplicity & stability
       - Ray filtering similarly effective but requires rasterizer modification
       - Fixed 16-Gaussian constraint ensures fair comparison

7. DISCUSSION (400 words)
   - Why masking works: Removes dynamic-induced optimization conflicts
   - Limitations: Depends on segmentation quality, PyBullet synthetic data
   - Generalization: Future work on real robotic datasets
   - Connection to SINDy: Masking acts as sparse prior on dynamics
   - Practical impact: Enables clean static backgrounds for navigation tasks

8. CONCLUSION (200 words)
   - Summary: 2D masks reduce static artifacts by 107x
   - Contribution: Simple, effective method for robot scenes
   - Future: Real-world validation, temporal consistency
   - Broader impact: Improves 3DGS for structured environments
